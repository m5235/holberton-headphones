[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) will be your friend!

During these projects, you won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.


It’s not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in company/start-up, you will discuss with designers, implement their work and make them review your implementation.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
* Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

## [1. Header ](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/624)
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations

## [2. "What we do..." section](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/624)
 create the “What we do…” section

## [3. "Our results" section ](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/624)

## [6. Replace background image with... code! !](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/624)
In the section “Our results”; without the use of an image file, draw each pentagon using HTML and CSS.

## [7. Let's animate items](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/624)
add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

## [8. And SASS??  ](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/624)
that will be the SASS version of it.
